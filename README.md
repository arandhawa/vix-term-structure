Exploring the VIX term structure with artificial neural networks  for my Bachelor's thesis.

## Long story short

This did not work out very good. Even though the network learned *something* it was always too basic to even beat the most
naive prediction even a human could do. Personal conclusion: Artificial neural networks are certainly great but that does not
mean they are suitable for every machine learning task.
